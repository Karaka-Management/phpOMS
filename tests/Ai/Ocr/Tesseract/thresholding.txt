Filtering Is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain
features or remove other features. Image processing operations implemented with filtering include smoothing, sharpening,

_ and edge enhancement.

Filtering is a neighborhood operation, in which the value of any given pixel in the output image is determined by applying
some algorithm to the values of the pixels in the neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel. A pixel'â€™s neighborhocd is
some set of pixels, defined by their locations relative to that pixel. (SeeNeighborhood or Block Processing: An Overview for
a general discussion of neighborhood operations.) Linear filtering is filtering in which the value ofan output pixel is a linear

combination of the values of the pixels in the input pixel's neighborhood.

Convolution
Linear filtering of an image is accomplished through an operation called convolution. Convolution is aneightornood

operation in which each output pixel is the weighted sum of neighboring input pixels. The matrix of weights is called the
convolution kemel, also known as the filter. A convolution kernel is a correlation kernel that has been rotated 1 20 cearses.

For example, suppose the image is

A=[17 24 1 8g 45
23 5 7 14 146
4 6 13 20 22
1@ 12 19 23 3
